# TheHylia File Grabber

This script will download all files at once, even without an account.

### Usage
Clone this repo:
`git clone `

To use it, cd into cloned repo and:
`bash copy.sh (your_url)`

It will create new folder based on page title, and files will be store in it.

Provide `(your_url)` with TH page that consist of list of tracks available for download and it will automatically parse links to download.

### Notes
- Recommended to run it on bash or zsh (instead of sh)
- Please be informed that this script only relies on how people at TheHylia maintained their site, meaning this is a hacky ( but working :) ) technique to obtain files efficiently, and fast. Please, please, please support them if you can!

### Bugs
You may freely open an issue for that.
